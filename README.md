# School-Policing-Data-Project

## Hello! Welcome to the School Policing Data Project! 

This project aims to provide urban residents with a data exploration tool that allows them to easily explore policing data in all forms (arrests, school resource officers, etc). In the spirit of data transparancy, this repo is public!
